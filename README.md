Animated Navigation

This code defines an animated navigation bar for a website. The code consists of 3 parts: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

HTML:

The HTML defines the structure and content of the webpage.
Within the HTML, there is a <nav> element that acts as a container for the navigation bar.
The navigation bar has an unordered list of 4 links for "Home", "Works", "About" and "Contact".
There is also a button with an id of "toggle" and two divs with class "line" that act as the hamburger icon for the navigation bar.

CSS:

The CSS styles the layout and appearance of the elements on the webpage.
The stylesheet sets the default font to "Muli" and defines the background color and gradient.
The stylesheet sets the layout of the <nav> element, including its width, padding, border radius, and box shadow.
It also defines the appearance of the navigation links and the hamburger icon.

JavaScript:

The JavaScript listens for a click event on the "toggle" button.
When the button is clicked, the JavaScript adds or removes the "active" class from the <nav> element.
The "active" class changes the width of the navigation bar and reveals the links.
The JavaScript toggles the appearance of the hamburger icon based on the state of the "active" class.
The result of this code is a responsive animated navigation bar that shows and hides the links when the hamburger icon is clicked.
